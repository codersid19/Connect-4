# Connect-4 AI Game

This project implements an intelligent AI player for the classic game Connect-4 using Python. With the Connect-4.py script, users can experience a challenging game against the AI, which utilizes advanced algorithms to make strategic moves and compete against human players.

## Features

- **Intelligent AI:** The AI player is designed to make strategic decisions based on the current state of the game board, aiming to win or prevent the opponent from winning.
- **Connect-4 Gameplay:** The game follows the standard rules of Connect-4, where players take turns dropping colored discs into a grid, aiming to connect four of their own discs in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Users can play against the AI in an interactive command-line interface, providing input to make their moves and witnessing the AI's responses.
- **Modular Code:** The codebase is modular and well-structured, allowing for easy customization and extension of the game logic and AI algorithms.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** The AI player is trained using reinforcement learning techniques, enabling it to learn and improve its gameplay through experience and feedback from game outcomes.

## Usage

To play Connect-4 against the AI:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `Connect-4.py` script using Python.
3. Follow the prompts in the command-line interface to make your moves and play against the AI.
4. Enjoy the game and challenge yourself to outsmart the AI player!
